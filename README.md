This pipeline is designed to handle messages that have been sent to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) by another Logstash pipeline or application. The input plugin reads messages from the DLQ directory (/usr/share/logstash/data/dead_letter_queue in this case) and adds the "dlq" tag to them.

The filter plugin is only applied to messages with the "dlq" tag. It uses a Grok pattern to extract information from the [@metadata][dead_letter_queue][reason] field, which typically contains details about why the original message failed to be processed. Specifically, it extracts the failed field name, the existing data type of the field, and the new data type that was expected.

The mutate filter is then used to modify the failed_field field by converting it to lowercase and replacing any colons with underscores. This makes it easier to use the field name in Elasticsearch index names.

Finally, the output plugin sends the DLQ messages to Elasticsearch, using the modified failed_field field, the existing and new data types, and the current date in the index name. The Elasticsearch index will be named "logstash-dlq-[failed_field]-[existed_type]-[new_type]-YYYY.MM.dd".

To set up this Logstash pipeline, you can create a new configuration file (e.g. dlq-pipeline.conf) in the /usr/share/logstash/pipeline/directory and paste the configuration code into it. You will need to replace the Elasticsearch host and password with your own values, and adjust any other settings as necessary for your environment. Once the configuration file is in place, you can start Logstash with the command systemctl start logstash.service. The pipeline will then begin processing messages from the DLQ.
